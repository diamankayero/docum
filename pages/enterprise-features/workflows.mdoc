Workflows allow you to automate notifications and reminders. A workflow can be attached to different event types, has one specific trigger event, and can have several action steps. For example, you can use workflows for sending email or SMS reminders before an event starts to the person who booked the meeting to avoid no-shows.

Workflows can also be used for sending follow-up emails or SMS messages to the attendee after a meeting ends. That could be a feedback survey, providing some additional information to the meeting, or just a simple thank you note.

Each Workflow is made up of a single trigger and one or more actions. Triggers include things like the cancellation of an event, start times, end times, and new bookings.

### Triggers

* Minutes/Hours/Days after an event ends

### Actions

* Send an email to the attendees
* Send an email to a specific email address
* Send an SMS to the attendee
* Send an SMS to a specific number
* Send Whatsapp message to the attendee

Actions are a designated notification type. For example, sending a reminder to an attendee, a specific phone number or an email address.

#### Custom template

You can either use the default template for the email/SMS or even use a custom template and use additional inputs as variables within that

The Workflow system also lets you choose between using Cal.com’s default message template or creating a custom one.

#### Dynamic text variables

If the location is a video conferencing app then the {LOCATION} would be ‘Zoom’ or ‘Google Meet’ and {MEETING_URL} would be the actual link to the meeting. If the location is not a video conferencing app then {MEETING_URL} is empty.
