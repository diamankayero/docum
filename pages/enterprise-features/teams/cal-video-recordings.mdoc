For our valued users with an active Teams plan, we offer the option to create recordings of meetings conducted through Cal Video. Recognizing the growing need for retrospective reviews and asynchronous collaboration, this feature ensures that important discussions, presentations, and decisions aren't lost post-meeting. These recordings can then be accessed by visting [past bookings](https://cal.com/bookings/past) and clicking on the **View Recordings** button on the specific event once the meeting has ended.
