Be sure to set the environment variable `NEXTAUTH_URL` to the correct value. If you are running locally, as the documentation within `.env.example` mentions, the value should be `http://localhost:3000`.

```
# In a terminal just run:
yarn test-e2e

# To open last HTML report run:
yarn playwright show-report test-results/reports/playwright-html-report
```
