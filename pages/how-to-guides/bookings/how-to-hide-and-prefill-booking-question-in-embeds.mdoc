---

You may have come across a scenario where you want to pre-fill some information in the booking form for your clients and/or hide them. For example, you may want it to be hidden from the scheduler but shown on your Google Calendar after it is scheduled. Here's a step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:

### Step 1: Accessing the event-type settings
1. Login to your Cal.com account

2. Navigate to the event-type you wish to add the hidden booking field to

3. Click on advanced tab

4. In the booking questions section, click on Add a question

5. Fill up the question and take note of the identifier, you'll need it when prefilling it

### Step 2: Hiding a booking question

3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Pre-filling a booking question

If you want to pre-fill a certain question, you'll need to append a query parameter to the booking page URL.

The query parameter should match the identifier for the field you wish to pre-fill. As long as it is hidden, the booker shouldn't see that in the booking page, and you can send any custom information you want through this method.
