Being instantly notified on Slack whenever you receive a booking can be a game-changer for professionals juggling a busy schedule. By integrating booking alerts directly into Slack, you can ensure that you're instantly aware of new appointments without constantly monitoring your email or Cal.com.

1. Go to [App store](https://app.cal.com/apps/categories/automation) and install Zapier app to your account.
2. On Zapier, create a `Zap` that sends you a slack message whenever you get booked.
