3. Click install.

4. Proceed through to connect your stripe account with Cal.com (if you don't already have an account with stripe, you can do so in this step as well)

5. Now that stripe is connected to your account, you can either open an existing event type or create a new one

6. In connected apps, you should see stripe. Simply confirm the price you wish your bookers to pay and click on `save`.
