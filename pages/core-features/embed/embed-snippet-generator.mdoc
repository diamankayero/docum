    a. Copy the HTML code snippet
    {% img src="/docs/images/i1600x900-mdLN0kkooRVB_juid5h.png" / %}

    b. Copy the React code snippet
    {% img src="/docs/images/i1600x900-pDo66wyQ4Zxc_zmljxo.png" / %}

You can also configure all the custom CSS variables supported by cal.com app. [Here is a list of all the supported CSS variables](https://github.com/calcom/cal.com/blob/main/packages/config/tailwind-preset.js#L18).

Also, [here is the codeSandbox demo](https://codesandbox.io/s/embed-advanced-css-vars-x2sdgy?file=/src/App.tsx) for a configuration where the look and feel of the embed is changed.
