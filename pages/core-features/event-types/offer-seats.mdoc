If you have an event type with the "Offer seats" feature toggled, you can have more than one attendee book a specific slot.

This feature would be useful for all those businesses, classes, seminars etc. that offer "seats" as in attendance spots. Just select the maximum number of seats in your event-type settings and your attendees will be able to book slots multiple times.
